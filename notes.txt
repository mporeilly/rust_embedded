.cargo/config.toml is the location for the runner file which will be executed with "cargo build or "cargo run"

memory.x defines the memory layout of the system (no idea what indicates to use it)

openocd.gdb lays out the commands that are run within gdb (reference in the runner within .cargo/config.toml)

before running need to open up the debugger with this command (in any place): openocd -f interface/stlink-v2-1.cfg -f target/stm32f3x.cfg

documentation can be viewed offline by "cargo doc --open --package stm32f3-discovery" - very useful

to view binary info: cargo readobj --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf --bin embedded_hello -- --file-header
